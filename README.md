# Restaurant management
### A handy helper for restaurant employees

### Description
It's the first ever appliacation I've ever written in Angular. The app provides support for reservations management, taking orders and tracking their status. The most important information about today's reservations and waiting orders is displayed on the homepage. The program also allows the users to create and modify their own profiles.

### Fetures
- User's profile creation and management
- Reservations handling
- Orders processing
- Filtering the dishes available on the menu
